# Welcome
In the first place, this blog doesn't have an explicit purpose or direction. Really, it's a place for me to talk about things that I find interesting or that I have been thinking about a lot, but can't really bring up in conversation with the people I would normally talk to. Hopefully, it will be clear why exactly that is. In some sense, these articles will be a one-sided conversation. A lecture, perhaps, but less formal. Like I said, I just want to talk about stuff without having to necessarily be engaging enough to warrant ignoring a conversation partner and launching into a long diatribe about the thing I want to say. The format also allows me to be more considerate of my words, though I'm trying to be as candid as possible. I expect many articles will go through a rotation of being archived as I no longer enjoy reading them, or as my writing gets better and the older stuff becomes worse by comparison.
I would hope also that no reader makes the mistake of expecting any sense of consistency. For one, this is a side project; I'm a full-time student, among other things, and this is a low priority thing that I'm doing when I can, or when I feel like it. For another, my opinions are likely to change based on the day and what I've last read, and I mean this blog to be entirely honest. What this means is that I might seem to have entirely different perspectives or thoughts on the same thing on different days -- do not take this to be a self-contradiction or evidence I have been obscure; on the contrary, it means that I have simply changed or slightly shifted my thinking on it.
I plan on coming out with my first article today. I hope you enjoy it.
