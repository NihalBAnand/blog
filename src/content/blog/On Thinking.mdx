# On Thinking
In this article, I want to talk about thinking in various senses, as well as what it means to be a thinker. I believe that we can rightfully characterize thinking in a few different, complementary ways that will allow us to more clearly identify what it is we are doing in a given circumstance, then take action accordingly.  
## Thinking about thinking
The first way to think about thinking is as metacognition -- that is, thinking about thinking itself. This article is an example of metacognition, but it's also present in much more pedestrian situations. If you're trying to solve a problem, the thought "this line of thinking won't work" is an example of metacognition. Indeed, this particular interpretation of the term is what is commonly studied in psychology and neuroscience, and it was this topic that was the focus of one of my fellow lab member's doctoral dissertation. [Here's a link to one such paper.](https://2024.ccneuro.org/pdf/384_Paper_authored_Malaiya_Warren_Golden_2024_Quantum_Random_Walk.pdf) What's helpful about metacognition is that it allows us to cogently consider our thought patterns and organize them in a way that is most helpful. People often say that the utility of a philosophy class is not necessarily the content, but the way that you are trained to think. What is this way? Metacognition. It is metacognition when we consider if our arguments make sense, when we question our beliefs, when we consider our behavior and evaluate it against our goals. This is the hallmark of the educated mind, more than thought patterns themselves or memorized information.  
  
The second way I want to think about thinking is as what we might also term "feeling," the unconscious attunement to a state of flow or flux. I don't mean this in a spiritual sense -- this is simply a deep, experiential understanding of the idea that a thing (and here I mean thing in its most abstract sense) is changing, and guiding or being guided by that change. You might call this a "flow state," "meditation," and musicians (myself included) will describe a similar feeling when "into it." There's a reason why Buddhists and Taoists, among others, use exalted language to describe this: in a lot of ways, it's the most "true" way of thinking. The world genuinely is constantly changing, you are constantly changing, everyone around you is constantly changing. Differential equations, relations that describe continuous changes, are everywhere in physics. Poetically and philosophically, we can see the connection between these ideas (though I don't dispute that factually, they are independent; I only mean that there is a resonance that can be meaningful to us), and we can use it to inform our ethics and personal moral codes. I don't think it's controversial to say that this is what we, in fact, do; even if you believe in moral realism (the proposition that moral facts exist and have truth value; for example, "murder is wrong" would be absolutely true or false to a moral realist, regardless of the existence of humans to believe such a statement) you "feel" the truth value of a given moral statement, and this feeling is used by the likes of CS Lewis to argue for the existence of God. I am not a moral realist, and am therefore more inclined to think about our morality in this feeling-based way, but my point is that this conclusion is not specific to my position on morality writ large.  
  
More than morality, though, feeling is how we understand and make sense of an encounter with the Other (the Other being another person, but more generally; think about it either as society or as an individual being encountered). When we meet the Other, they fundamentally interrupt our "flow," our feeling about how the world should be. Similarly, we interrupt theirs. We can choose to change our feelings, in an act of metacognition, to attune to a flow of the world that incorporates, or does not incorporate, the Other. (Again, I don't mean this spiritually. When I say "attune to a flow," I mean that we assent to an uncertain series of events that is set to follow this interaction.) This encounter highlights an important point I wish to make: all kinds of thinking, if they are to be useful, will interact with each other. We don't have split off parts of ourselves that are totally isolated -- we are a coherent whole, one entity that is either a convenient fiction or an emergent reality, depending on how you wish to interpret our constant change. If there were a type of thinking that were shut off from the rest, we would be split, and this is not how we experience the world. Again, there is nothing spiritual here, I am talking only phenomenologically (that is, having to do with first-person experience) about how my mind seems to work. To me, feeling is the most important mode of thinking (phenomenologically speaking), and other modes serve it insofar as they serve the improvement of the human condition. 
   
The third mode of thinking I want to highlight is analysis. Analysis is, generally, logical thinking. It is the thought patterns that I referenced in the section on metacognition, and it is the mechanical working out of mathematics. I exclude creative jumps here -- I imagine those to be more feeling. Think about analysis as your understanding of cause and effect, logical inference, and calculation. When you consider an analytical behavior, consider if the processes are the most correct and efficient that they can be. This is perhaps the simplest aspect of thinking to understand, dangerously so by my estimation. We often fall into the trap that analysis is all that thinking is, but this is overly reductive, I think. We often think irrationally, and I think this is fine. When we reject our own irrationality, we reject a fundamental aspect of being human. We are not machines, we are beings. I cast no value judgements on that, other than to say that it is impossible for an entity to fulfill itself by cutting away a fundamental aspect of itself. Self-actualization relies on an acceptance of all of ourselves, not just that which we may arbitrarily like or dislike. If we search the good life ("eudaimonia") we must take this step. Thus, analysis becomes demoted to its rightful place: complementary, not dominating.
## What is a thinker?
I'll start by saying that I don't think that a thinker is necessarily a vocation. You don't have to be a professional philosopher, or a scientist, or a poet, to be a thinker. I think what makes a thinker is the effort to harmonize feeling and analysis through metacognition, to whatever ends suit the thinker. Let's think for a moment about what that means. When we feel, we can choose, in the long run, which flows we attune to, with some taking more effort than others. You can imagine that it would take a lot of force to suddenly turn around if you were in a river -- it's the same concept. There's mental strain in changing your mind on a strongly held ethical belief, for example, but you can eventually get your thinking in line to where you want it, with sustained effort. On the other hand, slightly changing your course is much easier. How do you pick which flows to attune to? In most cases, this is an analytical question. You have a goal you've already chosen, so you attune to the flow you judge to be getting you closest to there. How do you choose your goals? This is the metacognitive question, and it's something that requires both analysis and feelings to derive. Ultimately, you do have to choose, and you do have to point yourself in some direction. The person who strives for the synthesis of these things is a thinker.  
  
I think most people could be thinkers. I'm not sure how many are -- I'm not in anyone's head but my own.
