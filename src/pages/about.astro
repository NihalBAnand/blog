          This blog is an attempt to organize what is now a diasporic set of documents on my computer. In some sense, I hope that this will serve as a compilation of what might be called my "philosophical project," but I mean that in the broadest possible way -- philosophy not in the narrow imagining of the word we consider common today, but as a more comprehensive worldview. I don't know what that worldview looks like in exact terms, and in many ways it's a moving target, but I hope that this website serves to give an insight into how I observe and interpret the world, in whatever capacity that may be interesting to you.

          Thanks for reading, and I do hope you enjoy your time here.
